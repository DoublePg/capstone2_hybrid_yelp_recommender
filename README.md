# Springboard_capstone_2
This capstone project is part of the data science career track program at Springboard. EDA and interactive visualizations are performed on Yelp open dataset (Yelp dataset challenge) to understand restaurant, user and review patterns on Yelp platform. A hybrid recommendation engine is further developed offering a combination of non-personalized keyword filtering recommendation, personalized content-based filtering recommendation, and collaborative filtering recommendation at users' choice.
