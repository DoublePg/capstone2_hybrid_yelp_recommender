    "The restaurant inventory will be filtered by keywords first, then ranked by its average rating or weighted smart rating taking into consideration the popularity (depending on user’s choice). The top-k restaurants from the list will be returned as the top-k recommendations.<br>\n",
    "* Module 2 - personalized content-based filtering recommender:<br>\n",
    "With user ID and restaurant’s metadata, build a content based filtering recommender module that recommends restaurants that are similar to user’s preference inferred from user’s past ratings. More specifically, pairwise similarity scores will be computed for restaurants based on their vectorized feature representation extracted using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer and recommend restaurants based on rankings of the weighted similarity score (e.g. cosine similarity). The important restaurant metadata to consider include categories, attributes, location.<br>\n",

Remember that the dataset has a total of 1,518,169 users, 188,593 businesses and 5,996,995 reviews. In terms of the user_id x business_id matrix, the matrix is very sparse (0.003% non-empty). Therefore, matrix factorization algorithms will be used to complete the highly sparse matrix and generate recommendations.<br>\n",

    "a) “Want customized recommendations based on your user history by providing your user ID?”  If no, activate the simple recommender module to provide base-case recommendations using location information and/or optional keywords<br>\n",
    "b) If yes, prompt to ask follow up question: “do you want to try something new based on people like you?” If yes, activate the collaborative filtering module to recommend new restaurants based on similar peers; otherwise, use content filter module to recommend similar restaurants. <br>\n",
    "* Other improvements:<br>\n",
    "Optimize restaurant ranking by weighting the average rating based on total number of ratings (popularity), weighting the individual rating according to their recency, etc. With a quick interactive question: “want smart rating instead?” The alternative restaurant ranking method based on the above weighted scores will be activated and used instead of the simple average rating.<br>\n",
    "* Potential caveats - cold start problem:<br>\n",
    "a) new restaurant → content-based recommendation module will be able to use the features (metadata) of the new restaurant and include it when generating recommendations.<br>\n",
    "b) new user → will be treated as if the user ID is not available (both has no user history) and similar recommender module will be used to recommend restaurants based on location, keywords, popularity, etc. \n",
